Thank you for contributing to **Vue Flext**.

This file explains the practical side of contribution: what kinds of changes are welcome, how to prepare a pull request, and what maintainers expect before review.

If you are new to the project, read [README.md](https://github.com/TrustMe-kz/vue-flext/blob/main/README.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/TrustMe-kz/vue-flext/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) first. This file assumes you already understand what Vue Flext is and how the codebase is organized.

---

## 1. What contributions are welcome

Useful contributions include bug fixes, documentation improvements, example templates, integration checks, performance improvements that preserve behavior, and Vue-side improvements that extend Vue Flext without changing core semantics.

Changes that affect syntax, public API, built-in module behavior, or other stability-sensitive parts should be discussed in an issue before implementation.

---

## 2. What usually needs discussion first

Open an issue before starting if your change does any of the following:

* Changes FlextDoc syntax or directive behavior
* Changes public API behavior or signatures
* Changes wrapper behavior around slots, `v-model`, preview rendering, or generated fields
* Changes semantics of built-in modules such as `put`, `math`, `cond`, or `match`
* Introduces a new directive
* Performs a large refactor across multiple parts of the system

This saves time for both contributors and maintainers.

---

## 3. What usually will not be accepted

The following kinds of changes are usually rejected:

* Breaking behavior changes without prior discussion
* Large formatting-only pull requests
* Architecture rewrites that were not requested
* Core-semantic changes made in the Vue wrapper instead of the Flext core
* Heavy new dependencies without strong justification
* Unrelated cleanup mixed into a functional PR

> 💡 **Keep changes focused** and easy to review.

---

## 4. Before you start

Before writing code, check existing issues and confirm that the problem has not already been discussed. For anything larger than a small fix, open an issue first and confirm direction with maintainers.

Prefer the smallest useful change. In Vue Flext, small diffs are much easier to review and much less likely to introduce regressions.

---

## 5. Development Setup

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the project locally.

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run lint
```

If you need to **inspect behavior interactively**, you can also run:

```shell
npm run test:app
```

> ⚠️ **Do not edit** `dist/` manually. Source of truth is `src/`.

---

## 6. Contribution Workflow

The normal workflow is simple:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your change
3. Implement the change in the smallest relevant area
4. Add or update tests
5. Run tests and build
6. Open a pull request with a clear description

A good pull request explains three things clearly: what problem it solves, what changed, and whether any user-visible behavior changed.

---

## 7. Pull Request Expectations

Each pull request should solve one clear problem. Keep the diff small, avoid unrelated refactoring, and match the existing code style.

If behavior changes, add or update tests. If examples or public behavior change, update documentation too. README examples and public API examples are part of the project contract and should stay accurate.

Before opening a PR, review your own diff and remove accidental formatting changes or unrelated edits.

---

## 8. Tests & Verification

Behavior changes should be covered by verification. This is especially important for wrapper API behavior, preview rendering, generated fields, and any integration point that depends on the Flext model.

Always run the full checks before submitting:

```shell
npm run build
npm run lint
```

> ⚠️ Do not remove or weaken tests just to make a change pass. If a fragile area is affected, add regression coverage.

---

## 9. Modules, Templates, & Docs

When possible, prefer extending Flext through modules instead of expanding core behavior. New modules should have clear behavior, examples, and tests.

Template-related contributions should keep templates declarative and predictable. Documentation contributions are welcome, especially when they improve clarity, examples, or explain real usage patterns better.

---

## 10. Review & Communication

Maintainers review pull requests when time allows. Some PRs may need revisions before merge. Not every contribution will be accepted, especially if it conflicts with the long-term direction or stability of the project.

Keep communication technical, clear, and respectful. If a change is discussed in an issue first, the review process is usually faster.

---

## 11. Practical Checklist

Before opening a pull request, make sure that:

* The change solves one clear problem
* The diff is limited to relevant files
* Tests were added or updated if needed
* `npm run lint` passes
* `npm run build` passes
* Docs/examples were updated if behavior changed
* The PR description explains the reason for the change

🎉 **Thanks for helping improve Flext.**
